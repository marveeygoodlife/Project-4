## My process

1.First thing I did was to Initialize my  project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I found out that creating a repo will make it easier to share my  code with the coding community if I need help.

2.I Look through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step is crucial because it  help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

3.Before adding any styles, I made sure to structure my  content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus   attention on creating well-structured content.

4.Next thing I did was to Write out the base styles for this  project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size and I got font's to use from Google-fonts.

5.My next step was to style the Html documents, I Started by  adding styles to the top of the page and work down. I only move to the next section when I was satisfied that I have completed the area I am working on.  I like to stay organized.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS transitions
- Mobile-first workflow(media queies)

### What I learned

I learnt that it's okay to search for answers while working on a project, I found out that it's easy to forget code when you don't practice often. But by searching for answers it'll reinforce your knowledge.

 Over the course of building the website, I learnt some new css tricks which I listed below. I incorporated researching code and using my notes to make it.. The {Transition} property and value added a lil bit of interactivity to the circles on my website, I learnt you can use them to rotate elements on a page.

I intend to learn more about this property and use it often in building more  website.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
 .feature-item:hover {
    transform:translateY(5px)
  }

.feature-item {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);}
```

### Continued development

As I continue to code, I want to learn more about media queries, CSS flex-box, Grid, Javascript and transition property. It requires lot's of exercises and practical to master this skills, but by building little website it Adds to ones knowledge..
